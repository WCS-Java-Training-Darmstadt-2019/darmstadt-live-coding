This project demonstrates the classpath.

There are 2 types of classpath: runtime and compiletime

Question: 
what is the difference?

Exercise:
To run the ClassPathMain it needs the commons-lang-2.6.jar to run

write a bash script that compiles ClassPathMain.java (without gradle)
write a bash script that runs ClassPathMain.java (without gradle)

Now add the dependency to commons-lang to the gradle build dependencies 
(check the website https://mvnrepository.com/ for the correct dependency)
